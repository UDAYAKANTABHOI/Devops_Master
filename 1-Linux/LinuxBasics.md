## What is Linux and why it is important in DevOps journey?
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for numerous Unix-like operating systems. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular operating systems in the world, powering a wide range of devices, from servers and desktop computers to smartphones and embedded systems.

Linux is highly regarded in the DevOps journey for several reasons:

* <B>Open-source nature:</B> Linux is open-source, which means its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This openness fosters a collaborative community that actively contributes to its development and improvement. DevOps practitioners appreciate this openness, as it allows them to customize the operating system to suit their specific needs and contribute back to the community.

* <B>Stability and reliability:</B> Linux is known for its stability and reliability. It has a robust architecture that can handle heavy workloads and provide consistent performance. These qualities are essential in DevOps, where reliability and stability are crucial to support continuous integration, deployment, and delivery processes.

* <B>Scalability:</B> Linux is highly scalable, allowing it to efficiently run on a wide range of hardware, from small embedded devices to large-scale server clusters. This scalability is valuable in DevOps, where applications need to scale up or down rapidly based on demand. Linux's scalability enables DevOps teams to deploy and manage their infrastructure effectively.

* <B>Extensive tooling and ecosystem:</B> Linux has a vast ecosystem of tools, libraries, and applications that are widely used in the DevOps space. Tools like Bash scripting, package managers (e.g., apt, yum), version control systems (e.g., Git), containerization platforms (e.g., Docker), and configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet) are commonly employed in DevOps workflows. Linux's compatibility with these tools makes it an ideal choice for DevOps practitioners.

* <B>Command-line interface (CLI):</B> Linux provides a powerful command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system and execute various tasks efficiently. The CLI is highly scriptable and automatable, making it well-suited for DevOps automation and orchestration. DevOps professionals leverage the CLI extensively to automate routine tasks, deploy applications, manage infrastructure, and perform system monitoring and troubleshooting.

Overall, Linux's open-source nature, stability, scalability, extensive tooling, and command-line interface make it a critical component of the DevOps journey. Its flexibility and robustness empower DevOps teams to build and manage scalable, reliable, and efficient infrastructure and applications.

## Linux Distribution
Linux distribution is an operating system that is made up of a collection of software based on Linux kernel or you can say distribution contains the Linux kernel and supporting libraries and software. And you can get Linux based operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions and these distributions are available for different types of devices like embedded devices, personal computers, etc. Around 600 + Linux Distributions are available and some of the popular Linux distributions are: 

* MX Linux
* Manjaro
* Linux Mint
* elementary
* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Solus
* Fedora
* openSUSE
* Deepin

## Architecture of Linux:
Linux architecture has the following components:

1. <B>Kernel:</B> Kernel is the core of the Linux based operating system. It virtualizes the common hardware resources of the computer to provide each process with its virtual resources. This makes the process seem as if it is the sole process running on the machine. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes. Different types of the kernel are: 
  
   1. Monolithic Kernel
   2. Hybrid kernels
   3.  Exo kernels
   4. Micro kernels
      
2. <B>System Library:</B> Isthe special types of functions that are used to implement the functionality of the operating system.
<B>3. Shell:</B> It is an interface to the kernel which hides the complexity of the kernel’s functions from the users. It takes commands from the user and executes the kernel’s functions.
4. <B>Hardware Layer:</B> This layer consists all peripheral devices like RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc.
5. <B>System Utility:</B> It provides the functionalities of an operating system to the user

# Advantages of Linux
* The main advantage of Linux, is it is an open-source operating system. This means the source code is easily available for everyone and you are allowed to contribute, modify and distribute the code to anyone without any permissions.
* In terms of security, Linux is more secure than any other operating system. It does not mean that Linux is 100 percent secure it has some malware for it but is less vulnerable than any other operating system. So, it does not require any anti-virus software.
* The software updates in Linux are easy and frequent.
* Various Linux distributions are available so that you can use them according to your requirements or according to your taste.
* Linux is freely available to use on the internet.
* It has large community support.
* It provides high stability. It rarely slows down or freezes and there is no need to reboot it after a short time.
* It maintain the privacy of the user.
* The performance of the Linux system is much higher than other operating systems. It allows a large number of people to work at the same time and it handles them efficiently.
* It is network friendly.
* The flexibility of Linux is high. There is no need to install a complete Linux suit; you are allowed to install only required components.
* Linux is compatible with a large number of file formats.
* It is fast and easy to install from the web. It can also install on any hardware even on your old computer system.
* It performs all tasks properly even if it has limited space on the hard disk.

# Disadvantages of Linux
* It is not very user-friendly. So, it may be confusing for beginners.
* It has small peripheral hardware drivers as compared to windows.

# Is There Any Difference between Linux and Ubuntu? 
Linux refers to the open-source operating system kernel that was initially developed by Linus Torvalds. The Linux kernel is the core component of various operating systems known as Linux distributions or distros. Linux distributions typically include additional software, utilities, graphical interfaces, and package management systems to create a complete operating system.

Ubuntu, on the other hand, is a specific Linux distribution based on Debian Linux. It was created by Canonical Ltd. and has gained significant popularity as a user-friendly and versatile Linux distribution. Ubuntu provides a complete operating system that includes the Linux kernel, a graphical user interface (GUI) called GNOME, and a wide range of software packages.

In summary, Linux is the underlying kernel, while Ubuntu is a specific Linux distribution that utilizes the Linux kernel along with additional software and tools to create a complete operating system. Ubuntu is just one of many Linux distributions available, each with its own characteristics, package management systems, and default configurations.
