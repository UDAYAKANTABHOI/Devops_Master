# What is DevOps
In simple word Devops means everything which is improving your release cycle including Development , testing , deployment with high stability , high speed infrastructure and with less complexities .

## Why DevOps ?
The software industry is growing at the speed of light, but software delivery in IT firm is suffering from a lack of department integration. Problems are lobbed over the wall across the team and process is suffering. As a developer, you need to wait for work to get aligned with production and operation team. Moreover, most recurring challenges for developers to balance pending and new codes along with errors solving when new code is pushed into the production environment. Here DevOps helps you get the job done.

This happens when the production environment is not identical with the development department. Take the operation team in the scenario, as a system administrator, they are responsible for production environment uptime with maintaining code deployment schedule.

That is why DevOps came in the picture. It is based on the simple fact that Development and operation work better together to have better collaboration, communication with reduced friction in the process. DevOps is derived from Development and Operation. DevOps framework inherits from the agile system administration movements .It works to improve collaboration between teams for better product delivery, profitability and satisfied customers.

It is achieved by automating most of the process like software delivery, workflow, testing and infrastructure designs. To avoid complexity, it is done in small intervals. It also builds an identical environment for Operation and development team.

It is a super-framework. It connects the dots between other frameworks, tools, vocabulary, practices, and principles. Most importantly, the goal is to inspire systems thinking across entire value stream, in order to deploy frequently and faster. For example, DevOps shift-left approach helps testing, development, security, and operational professionals engage their practices and processes earlier as an integral facet of the entire system instead of as some downstream activity.

With implementing DevOps culture you can make your product more stable , secure by providing quality releases in very short time .
